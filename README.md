# Web-apps deployment

This repository aims to deploy some web apps along with the nginx-proxy usign
docker and docker-compose.

This project is based on the following:

- [jwilder/nginx-proxy](https://hub.docker.com/r/jwilder/nginx-proxy) 

- [Wordpress](https://hub.docker.com/_/wordpress) 

- [Nextcloud](https://hub.docker.com/_/nextcloud)

## How to use

Clone the repository and use the script `deploy-all.sh` to deploy all the
applications in this project.

```[bash]
./deploy-all.sh
```

The script receives the following environment variables:

| Variable     | Default          |
| -------------| ---------------- |
| HOST_DOMAIN  | localhost        |
| EMAIL_DOMAIN | mail@example.com |
| WP_DB_PASS   | mywppass         |
| NEXT_DB_PASS | mynextpass       |
| WITH_NGINX   |   (none)         |

These variables could be declared inline or exported globally.

## Configurations

For a usable Nextcloud application you should configure the
`client_max_body_size` in the nginx-proxy, otherwise file uploads will be
restricted to 1Mb.

The recommended procedure is to create a file in the `vhost.d` folder 
under `nginx-proxy` with the name of the subdomain (Ex. `nextcloud.mydomain.com`) and with the following content:

```
client_max_body_size 3072m;
```

These settings allow a maximum value of 3Gb for the files to be
uploaded. Otherwise, will receive a 413 code from the server.
